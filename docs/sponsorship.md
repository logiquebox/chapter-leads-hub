# OSCA Sponsorship :moneybag:

Open Source Community Africa provides funding to Chapter Leads for community events and initiatives. We are delighted to provide funding and other support to enable you to effectively build your community. We will support:

 - Events and initiatives related to open-source.
 - Events and initiatives focused on your community.
 - Events and initiatives that are valuable to your community.
 
## Sponsorship Guidelines

1. You need to have completed your previous event's post-event-report before opening a new issue for an event. Writing a Post-event report is **compulsory**.
2. Event expenses will be sponsored or reimbursed only if approved before the event.
3. Please add a breakdown of your budget for each event issue you open.
4. Ensure to keep every receipt associated with the event; you need this to request for reimbursement.
5. Please help us help you by spending responsibly.

## External Sponsorship

You are not expected to rely solely on Open Source Community Africa for support. Ensure you engage and request sponsorship from other companies whose goals align with your events.

Sponsorship doesn't have to be funding; you can get job opportunities, internship opportunities, coupons, resources, swags, media services, etc.

We can't promise to support all the events that you request funding for. If you rely solely on us for funding and don't develop relationships with other sponsors, you are eventually going to have budget issues when you need more than we can provide.

## Invoicing

Expenses must be approved in advance. Please send us an overview of your budget during your event submission.

After approval:

- OSCA will sponsor Chapter Leads for approved costs associated with a relevant event. (Please keep your receipts)
- Upon event completion, you will submit your expense receipts and proof of purchases.
