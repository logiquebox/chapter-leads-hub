# Expenses and Sponsorship

All expenses must be approved **before** the event. Expenses not approved before spending will not be reimbursed.

## What can be sponsored?

Open Source Community Africa will sponsor or reimburse a Chapter Lead for approved costs associated with a relevant activity. This could include:

- Small costs of running an event (e.g., light refreshment or logistics)
- Reuseable materials for multiple events (e.g., a roll-up banner)

## Getting approval for a sponsorship

Before your expense is approved, an estimate must be provided. However, this estimate does not have to be exact but should be a good approximation of the cost. 

Once you have worked out an estimate of the cost, include it in your issue and when you fill the sponsorship request form. OSCA's Finance or Community Manager will then comment to approve or ask further questions.

## Sponsorship note

It's important to remember that the budget available for sponsorship is limited and you should do your best to use it responsibly. Help us help you by spending responsibly. Please note, we need **21 days' notice at maximum** to provide any sponsorship.

Expenses will be paid to your local bank, accepted payment methods (for non-Nigerians), or reimbursed via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/osca). Once your expense has been approved, OSCA's Finance or Community Manager will communicate the estimated time of arrival of the funds. When you make purchases, ensure to keep all receipts and proof of purchase. You will need them to follow the steps in the next section.
