We created guidlines around sponsorships, please make sure to check them [here](/chapter-leads-hub/blob/master/docs/sponsorship.md) before opening an issue.

## Here's a Request Example:

Let's say you want to host a workshop on for your chapter in Lagos State, Nigeria.

🎖 **Open an issue**

You will open an issue "Open Source Workshop at University of Lagos", and describe what you're planning to do as requested in the issue template.

🏷 **Add lables**

You will then add the labels "Nigeria" and "Workshop" (Your location) to describe where you are and what you're organizing, and add "swag wanted" (Type(s) of request) if you'll would like OSCA to send you some stickers and t-shirts.


🤵🏽👩‍🏫 **Tag anyone you think can help you**

You will then tag the community manager or any other team member to help with your request.

✨ **Host the event!**

After getting your event and request approved, you will then proceed to host the workshop.

👍 **Submit your event report**

You will then return to the created issue to tell everyone how it went including photos from the event, relevant social media posts, number of attendees and other details. You will will create the post event report using the [Post Event Template](/chapter-leads-hub/blob/master/docs/post-event-template.md) and submit any expenses by following the [Expense procedure](/chapter-leads-hub/blob/master/docs/expenses.md)
