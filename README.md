## Sponsorship Guidelines
We created guidlines around sponsorships, please make sure to check them [here](/chapter-leads-hub/blob/master/docs/sponsorship.md) before opening an issue.

## Here's a Request Example:

Let's say you want to host a workshop on "Introduction to Open Source" for your chapter in Lagos State, Nigeria.

🎖 **Open an issue**

You will open an issue "Introduction to Open Source Workshop at University of Lagos", and describe what you're planning to do as requested in the issue template.

🏷 **Add lables**

You will then add the labels "Nigeria" (Your location) and "Workshop" (Event Type) to describe where you are and what you are organizing alongside any other related tag(s). See all tags [here](https://github.com/oscafrica/chapter-leads-hub/tags).


＠ **Tag anyone you think can help you**

You will then tag the community manager or any other OSCA team member to help with your request.

✨ **Host the event!**

After your event and request is approved, you will then proceed to host the workshop.

👍 **Submit your event report**

You will then return to the created issue to report how the event went including photos, relevant social media posts, reports and other details. You will hence create the post event report using the [Post Event Template](/chapter-leads-hub/blob/master/docs/post-event-template.md) and submit any expenses by following the [Expense submission guideline](/chapter-leads-hub/blob/master/docs/expenses.md)

✅ **Close the issue**

You have done well, mission complete!
