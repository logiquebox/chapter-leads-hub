## Here's a Request Example:

Let's say you want to host a workshop on "Introduction to Open Source" for your chapter in Lagos State, Nigeria.

🎖 **Open an issue**

You will open an issue titled *"Introduction to Open Source Workshop | Lagos | 2021/10/13"*, and describe what you're planning to do as requested in the issue template.

🏷 **Add lables**

You will then add the labels "Nigeria" (Your location) and "Workshop" (Event Type) to describe where you are and what you are organizing alongside any other related tag(s). See all tags [here](https://github.com/oscafrica/chapter-leads-hub/labels).

＠ **Tag anyone you think can help you**

You will then tag the community manager to help with your request. Once reviewed, your event will be approved or rejected.

🗣 **Publicize the event**

Once your event is approved, create a banner for your event using the design guidelines, create an RSVP page with which you will collect important information from your attendees before the event, and share both with the global/local OSCA community on Discord and social media.

✨ **Host the event!**

After your event and request is approved, you will then proceed to host the workshop.

👍 **Submit your event report**

After the event is completed, return to the created issue and submit a post event report. Your report should include photos, relevant social media posts, reports and any other details. To create the post event report, use the [Post Event Template](/docs/post-event-template.md), submit the report as a comment under the issue, and submit any expenses by following the [Expense submission guideline](/docs/expenses.md).
